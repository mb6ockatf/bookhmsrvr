This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or programming, yet progresses rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced level of instruction ... all the while sneaking in little nuggets of UNIX® wisdom and lore.
It serves as a textbook, a manual for self-study, and as a reference and source of knowledge on shell scripting techniques.
The exercises and heavily-commented examples invite active reader participation, under the premise that the only way to really learn scripting is to write scripts.
